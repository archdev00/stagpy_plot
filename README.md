# StagPy_Plot
A Jupyter Notebook for plotting fields from a StagYY output.

## First steps:
Create a virtual environment for StagPy in your preferred directory with this command:\
`python3 -m venv myenv`

Now activate the environment (Linux):\
`source myenv/bin/activate`

Install StagPy:\
`pip install stagpy`

Now you can use the Jupyter notebook using the virtual environment as the Jupyter Kernel.
